Designed and developed a system that translates natural language queries into SQL for dynamic database querying. Utilized large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and LLaMA, combined with schema-aware prompting to understand complex user intent. Integrated the model into a Streamlit web application that interacts with a multi-table SQLite database (music store schema), enabling users to retrieve data through intuitive English queries without writing SQL. Focus areas included model prompting, real-time query generation, error handling, and performance optimization.
